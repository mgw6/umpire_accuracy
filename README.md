# umpire_accuracy

Final project for Econ 416 - Senior Seminar at [St. John Fisher College](https://www.sjfc.edu/) in Rochester, NY.

Based on the [Umpire Scorecards Twitter Page](https://mobile.twitter.com/umpscorecards?lang=en),
this project aimed to look at how an umpire would perform in their next game behind the plate based on their performance of the previous game. 

In order to follow my workflow, run these codes in this order:
1. get_umpire_performance.ipynb
2. other_game_factors.ipynb
3. make_final_data.ipynb

All of the necessary datasets will be generated in the code, with the exception of the umpire_game_pks, which can be found 
[here](https://billpetti.github.io/baseball_tools/).

Should you be interested in the final paper I wrote on this, feel free to [reach out via email](mailto:magwin2012@gmail.com).
